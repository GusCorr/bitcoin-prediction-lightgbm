# Bitcoin Price Prediction using LightGBM

This project implements a high-performance Machine Learning pipeline to predict Bitcoin (BTC) price movements using historical data. By leveraging **LightGBM**, the goal is to handle large-scale time-series data efficiently while maintaining high predictive accuracy.

## Project Objective
Predicting cryptocurrency prices is a complex challenge due to high volatility and non-linear market behaviors. This project focuses on:
- Engineering robust technical indicators from raw OHLC data.
- Utilizing Gradient Boosting (LightGBM) for fast and scalable training.
- Implementing a modular software architecture for production-ready Data Science.

## Project Structure
